Home Assistant on Android phone through Termux app
==================================================

Why use Android phone instead of Rasberry Pi or router running OpenWrt
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Easy to use 
  * More powerful. Normally had more RAM. 
  * With Battery
  * Display
  * Lower power consumption

Why Termux
----------
  I'm tring to make home assistant working on unrooted Android phone. I tried QPython3, python for android with SL4a and both didn't work as expected. I know Gnuroot should work but it seems not simply enough.
  
Goal
------
  Make the home assistant install process as simple as possible.
